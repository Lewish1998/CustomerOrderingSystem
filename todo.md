# Customer Ordering System

## You are required to build an application in Java that an end user can interact with via a Command-Line Interface (CLI). The application required is a customer ordering system, that needs to be able to perform the following create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations:

*   Add a customer to the system.
*    View all customers in the system.
*    Update a customer in the system.
*    Delete a customer from the system.
*    Add an item to the system.
*    View all items in the system.
*    Update an item in the system.
*    Delete an item from the system.
*    Create an order in the system.
*    View all orders in the system.
*    Delete an order from the system.
*    Add an item to an order.
*    Delete an item from an order.

## When considering the entities in this domain: 

*    A customer needs to have a name.
*    An item needs to have a name and a value.
*    An order needs to have a customer and one or more items.
