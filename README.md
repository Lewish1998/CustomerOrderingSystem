For this project I decided to make use of the Visual Studio Code IDE as that is what I have used previously and am more confident in using. WHen setting up the environment I first had to ensure that I had the correct JRE installed on my machine so that I would be able to run the code, and also have necessary VS Code extensions to help with syntax. I also ensured that Maven was installed so that I could used it to create and build my project easier than using pure Java.
For the database I decided tto use PostgreSQL as, again, it is sometthing that I have used previously and am more confidentt using over MySQL.
